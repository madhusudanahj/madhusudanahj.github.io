Introduction:

This is a practical example where we develop a airport and airline data analysis dashboard development project in tableau. This is useful for identifying where the various flights are going and what is the most busy and most lengthy routes from the airport. This allows us to increase the number of flights on these routes by understanding the demand, thus  improving the customer serve during these times and the customer satisfaction. 

I have also created a hidden filter within the dashboard to filter between dates, distances and locations.
